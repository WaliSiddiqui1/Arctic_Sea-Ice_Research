Space of coding to calculate fluxes and sea ice interaction data. The purpose of these files is to isolate tidal impacts vs weather impacts over time
What has been done so far is that we have looked closely at the velocity and speed profiles of buoys in the Arctic, especially in the summer months using the asfs30 data in conjunction with other buoy data. We see that wind speed plays a large role in ice velocity, though some models and numbers may be checked for complete accuracy. 
Now we need to study better the effects of ocean currents on ice velocity motion. How internal convection and temperatures effects ice movement is something that needs to be studied. Furthermore, we have looked at buoy depths in the Arctic and have mapped it along a track. It would be good in the future to make a plot, map, or chart relating depths to ice velocity, and then relating that to ice velocities without wind velocity contributions based on our models.

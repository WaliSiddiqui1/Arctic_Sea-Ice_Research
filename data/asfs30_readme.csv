quality_control: Significant quality control is in place for the observations used in the derived products. This Level 3 data is processed in many significant ways that improve upon prior data levels. This Level 3 data should be used unless you have a specific reason to use a lower level.
qc_flags: -1 = No Data: Instrument was not functional and no data exists.
0 = Good: High certainty that data is accurate to within the expected measurement uncertainty.
1 = Caution: Use data with caution as there is reason to believe that the data might have a higher uncertainty than expected and/or is adversely impacted in some way.
2 = Bad: Data is determined to be clearly erroneous (out of range, does not pass quality control, is adversely impacted in some way, etc). Data has been removed.
3 = Engineering: Data collected was designed for engineering or testing purposes and not for general scientific use.  Data has been removed.
wind_sector_qc_info_flag: Quality control flags specifically for wind sectors as related to derived turbulence products. This flag indicates if the prevailing wind direction is under the influence of certain obstacles on the sea ice.  The flags are defined as follows:
- 10: In Polarstern sector (i.e. Caution)
- 11: In Polarstern sector and in footprint (i.e., Bad)
- 12: In Polarstern sector and above sig2/ustar threshold (i.e. Bad)
- 20: In Met Hut sector (i.e. Caution)
- 21: In Met Hut sector and in footprint (i.e., Bad)
- 22: In Met Hut sector and above sig2/ustar threshold (i.e. Bad)
- 30: In Tower sector (i.e. Caution)
- 31: In Tower sector and in footprint (i.e., Bad)
- 32: In Tower sector and above sig2/ustar threshold (i.e. Bad)
- 40: Other issue
data_provenance: Based on data from the mosseb.asfs30.level2.4.10min datastream with doi: https://doi.org/10.18739/A2K649V1F 
turbulence_qc_flags: Applies to all derived EC-based turbulence parameters
bulk_qc_flags: Applies to all derived bulk-based turbulence parameters
